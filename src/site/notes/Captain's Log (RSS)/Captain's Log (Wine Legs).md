This will be a very short entry. I'm exhausted tonight.

I went to the museum to see Monet in Venice. It was absolutely amazing. Just really gorgeous. I ended up spending 5-6 hours there because we lost my dad's ticket, and then i had to wait for my mom to come so I could give her the second ticket. I'm not used to staying outside so long so I was soo tired when I got back home. I actually slept through part of my group therapy. Like. A lot of it. But it's all worth it because I got to see the Wine Legs we were all obsessed with on Tumblr years ago. Tomorrow I will talk more about Monet. I've recorded audio, video, and pictures, so you can really be immersed in it. 

Also sorry the links don't work on my other two logs I'm very new to Obsidian and I'm not changing it just in case Quartz posts them all at once and gets me marked as spam.
