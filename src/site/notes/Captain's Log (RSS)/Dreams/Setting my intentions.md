Dreams are weird man. I can't remember what I dreamt last night, and the last few have been atrocious, so I'm setting my intentions for tonight.
I want my dream to be 

- enjoyable
- entertaining
- relaxing

and most importantly,

- restful

If I can just have a nice dream (and wake up on time, that would be great)
