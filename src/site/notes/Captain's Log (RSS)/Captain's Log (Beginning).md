I switched from basic HTML and CSS to Quartz SSG and Obsidian cause its easier. I haven't logged into Obsidian on my phone yet though because I'm NOT fuckin paying for sync!!!!!! Anyway I'm gonna try to use a plugin. Hopefully I can also deploy from my phone. I used a plugin to deploy. Next step is adding style to it. And figuring out where to put the directory. And learn wiki links. Anyway I really love this setup because it's easier for me to upload but also because it's easier to customize? in a way? I mean I sort of want more control but at the same time I don't mind. I will have to do some work to figure out how the CSS works, because it says its heavy on JS and I'm really not interested in learning that.
